# Jupyter-Notebook
Data analysis projects, which focus on the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques.
Walking through the next mini projects, you will  be familiar with my experiences relating to:
 * data cleaning
 * identifying unrealistic values
 * detect outliers, null and duplicated values
 * impute missing
 * data data visualization (exploratory, explanatory).
